## Instruction of Using Lab VPN
The Lab VPN can be used to connect to the Lab Network and use the services inside the Lab. ~~It cannot be used to climb over the wall.~~ (Based on some security consideration, the network management team of TCloud will no longer provide port forwarding service for workstations.)

#### Account Registeration
Please contact Jiacheng (5406) or Jin (5406) for a VPN account. They will give you an account with a default password, and you can change the password later.

#### Use the VPN
You need to install additional software to use the VPN. Both [OpenConnect](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) or [Cisco Anyconnect](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/index.html) are usable. If you are using Ubuntu with Gnome, you can install [this](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/net/network-manager-openconnect-gnome) package. For Android and IOS users, you can download Cisco Anyconnect from the official app store. Use 5406's public IP address to connect.
